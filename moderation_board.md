# Current moderation board

## Pilot phase

During our first year, 2019-2020, we are piloting this approach with a limited number of DOI assignments. 
Therefore, we will only accept submissions from invited events.

* Why? 
  * DOIs have a price and during the first year we have a limited number of those.

* Will this change? 
  * Yes, we are looking forward to creating a sustainable model that will allow us to host many more submissions.

* How can I contribute to building such a sustainable model?
  * If you want to become a sponsor, please [send us an email](mailto:biohackrxiv@googlegroups.com).

* Our event is not listed as a supported event, could we still submit articles to BioHackrXiv?
  * Please [send us an email](mailto:biohackrxiv@googlegroups.com), the BioHackrXiv steering committee will assess cases on individual basis.
