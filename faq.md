## Submissions and publications

* What is the main advantage of publishing my work in BioHackrXiv?
  * Most works coming out of BioHackathon-like events have no place in traditional publications, 
  including domain-based preprints as they commonly do not report on-going work, BioHackrXiv does. 
  We have created BioHackrXiv to fulfil a need observed as organizers and participants of the 
  NBDC/DBCLS BioHackathon and BioHackathon Europe series. 
  
* Whom I can contact in case of questions on the appropriateness of my article?
  * Please check the [submission guidelines](./submission_guidelines.md) as you will find there information on the 
  kind of submissions that will be considered.
  If you still have doubts, you can contact us by [email](mailto:biohackrxiv@googlegroups.com)
  
* Should I suggest potential referees to review my manuscript?
  * There is no peer-review process for preprints. We follow a [moderation process](./moderation_process.md) 
  with pre-established moderation boards.

* I understand there is no peer- review process, how do you ensure the material you get has a decent quality?
  * We follow a [moderation process](./moderation_process.md) but quality is not part of it.
  
* Are submissions in color (in contrast to black&white) accepted?
  * Either color or black&white submissions are accepted.    
  
* How long after a BioHackathon-like event is over can I still submit a manuscript?
  * Moderation boards will remain open for 18 months but we still can accept later submissions. 
  However, in order to keep the novelty factor of work done during hackathon-like events, 
  we recommend to submit during the first 6 months after.  
  
* How much time typically does it take to publish my work in BioHackrXiv?
  * We aim to have a decision before 5 days but the process can take up to two weeks.
  
* Will my paper be tagged as being the output of one specific event? E.g. Biohackathon 2019?
  * It will not be tagged but the event will be clearly visible on the generated PDF. 
  For more information on the PDF generation visit the [generator tool pages](https://github.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-gen-pdf).
  
* Will my manuscript get a DOI?
  * Yes, it will.
  
* What if I want to publish an update or follow up on a manuscript I already published in BioHackrXiv but 
that was developed outside a hackathon (e.g. offline collaborations)? Can I still publish it?
  * We restrict the publication of preprints in BioHackrXiv to material that has been initiated or 
  developed during a BioHackathon-like event. 
  
* Can I correct errors on my preprint after publication? How?
  * Yes, you can always resubmit a new version. Go to your submissions (you will need to log in on the 
  [OSF preprints website](https://osf.io/preprints/)), locate the one you want to re-submit and follow 
  the process you did as part of the initial submission.
  
* Can I remove a preprint that was already published? (=withdraw my manuscript)
  * Yes, you can do so but it is not an automatic/immediate process and requires approval by the Steering Committee. 
  You can go to your submission list and then use the button “Withdraw” , you must submit a reason to do so and then the 
  Steering Committee will decide whether or not to approve it. You will be notified once a decision has been made.
  
* Will BioHackrXiv keep the rights on my preprint?
  * No, authors own rights. 
  
* My preprint has not been published even though I got a confirmation that it was accepted, what should I do?
  * Please contact as at: biohackrxiv@googlegroups.com

* Can I submit my article to another journal after getting it published in BioHackrXiv?
  * Some peer-reviewed journals do accept submissions that have been shared before as a preprint. 
  We recommend you always consult the other journal policies.
  
* Where can I find the names of the people in the moderation board, steering committee, etc?
  * Find here the [moderation process](./moderation_process.md) page where you will find the list of 
  moderation boards and people involved. Current steering committee members are listed at the 
  [BioHackrXiv website](https://biohackrxiv.org/).    


## Payments

* Do I need to pay for getting my manuscript published in BioKacrXiv?
  * No, we offer our preprint server for free. We do welcome sponsorship, if your institution is interested in becoming a sponsor, 
  please send us an [email](mailto:biohackrxiv@gmail.com).
  
* Is there a fee to read the preprints already published?
  * BioHackrXiv, as part of OSF preprints, promotes Open Science; therefore, there is no fee to get access to any of 
  the preprints available under BioHackrXiv.

## Technical corner

* Is there an API to perform text mining on the preprints?
  * We do not provide a dedicated API for BioHackrXiv but OSF does, visit [OSF API pages](https://developer.osf.io/) 
  for more information.
