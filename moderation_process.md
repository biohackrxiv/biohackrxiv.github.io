# Moderation process

As a preprint, BioHackrXiv holds no peer-review process. We follow a basic checklist as detailed on the following section. Any submitted article will go through this checklist and a member of the corresponding moderation board will decide whether it can be accepted or not. There is one moderation board per eligible event (more information on moderation boards and the eligible events can be found on the [journal policies](./journal_policies.md)). We aim to notify about submission in a lapse from 2 to 5 days but the process can take up to two weeks.

## Our checklist

* Article is written in English and contains a language appropriate for publication
  * We will not do a proof-reading but we will do a basic check up (e.g., no offensive words, article actually written in English, reported work actually corresponding to a BioHackathon-type event)
* Article complies to the [submission guidelines](./submission_guidelines)
* First, last or corresponding author participated in the BioHackathon-type event where the reported work was initiated or advanced
* After a quick basic look, authors and affiliations seem to be legit
* After a quick basic look, manuscript appears to be indeed original

If the article is suitable for publication at BioHackrXiv, it will be accepted and a DOI will be assigned. Once a DOI is assigned, preprints become a public record and therefore their metadata must be preserved. Accepted articles can still be withdrawn with the approval of the BioHackrXiv steering committee. More information on the [withdrawn process](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360021490833-Withdrawing-a-Preprint) can be found at the OSF pages.
