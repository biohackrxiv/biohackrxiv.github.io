## About

[BioHackrXiv](https://biohackrxiv.org/) is a preprint to report on works done during BioHackathons, CodeFests, Sprints or similar events and related to Life Sciences and Health Care domains. Articles in BioHackrXiv commonly report on-going work as a couple of days of hacking are commonly not enough to get the things fully done. However, hackathon reports should still show work that people can build upon.

One of the reasons behind BioHackathons and similar is sharing: ideas, data, designs, software, documentations and tutorials among others. We therefore kindly ask you to use [CC-BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) for your work. We also encourage you to share your code on GitHub, with an open license whenever possible.

## Background

Unconferences with the purpose of supporting software development such as hackathons or codefests increasingly happen at different science domains. In life sciences, they vary from one day to one-week activity, sometimes collocated with other major events or on their own. Hackathon and codefest activities are driven by practical sessions where people gather, discuss, model, and implement ideas/projects during intensive and productive coding sessions. These meetings produce results in the form of discussion notes, sketches, models, designs, software or workflows, e.g., Jupyter Notebooks. The idea of adding a preprint service for publications coming from BioHackathons, i.e., hackathons in the health care and life sciences domain, is to collect research related reports which lead to full-fledged publications in time. Also, the collection of publications can be aggregated into a meta-publication for the meeting in question.

The people behind BioHackrXiv has participated on multiple BioHackathons organized by [National Bioscience Database Center](https://biosciencedbc.jp/en/) (NBDC) / [Database Center for Life Science](http://dbcls.jp/index-en.html) (DBCLS) in Japan ([NBDC/DBCLS BioHackathon](http://biohackathon.org/)) and [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/) ([ELIXIR BioHackathon](https://www.biohackathon-europe.org/)). We decided to create BioHackrXiv preprint in order to make it easier for all to share and report on the work done at this sort of events. Of course, any hacking event is welcome to publish here, the more the merrier they say! And, if you want to go for a more formal peer-reviewed publication, you can always do so once your work is more mature.
